# 7-Segment-Digital-Clock

Schema of the large DIY 7 segment digital clock as found on my youtube channel:

The version you can find here is simplified and easier if you want to make a clock like this yourself. So you don't need the App as shown in the video. The date and time is set when you upload the code to the Arduino. 

I hope you like it and if you made one yourself please let me know and send me some pictures! :D
